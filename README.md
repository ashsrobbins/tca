# Tensor Component Analysis Visualizations 
Analysis of TCA applied to learning problems. We can pull out trajectories of learning through observing neural weights through time. The main backbone is [tensortools](https://github.com/ahwillia/tensortools).

To run this tool:
-Clone this repository
-navigate to the directory
-Make sure to install requirements file

    pip install -requirements.txt

-Run it (cell by cell to follow along!)
